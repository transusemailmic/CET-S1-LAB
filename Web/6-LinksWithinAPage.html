            The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.[1] Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may be on the same device. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually does not share its computing resources, but it requests content or service from a server and may share its own content as part of the request. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client–server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.

        <p>
            Web application architecture consists of two main types: structural components and user interface (UI) components. Structural components form the core framework of a web application, including the client or web browser, web app server, and database server, which together handle user interactions and data processing. Technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are typically used to build these, though this can vary by developer. In contrast, UI components focus on the visual and interactive elements of the application, such as dashboards, widgets, settings, and notifications. While they do not directly interact with the app’s architecture, they play a crucial role in enhancing user experience (UX) by shaping how users engage with the interface.

        <h1 id="h3"><u>Types of Web Addresses</u></h1>
        <img src="C:\Users\cacet\Desktop\Sample\link.jpg" alt="Web Address" width="300" border="3">
        <p>
          A uniform resource locator (URL), colloquially known as an address on the Web,[1] is a reference to a resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),[2][3] although many people use the two terms interchangeably.[4][a] URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (HTTP/HTTPS) but are also used for file transfer (FTP), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications. Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar. A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname (www.example.com), and a file name (index.html).

        <h1 id="h4"><u>HTTP Request</u></h1>
        <img src="C:\Users\cacet\Desktop\Sample\http-request.png" alt="HTTP Request" width="300" border="3">
        <p>
          HTTP defines methods (sometimes referred to as verbs, but nowhere in the specification does it mention verb) to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable residing on the server. The HTTP/1.0 specification[49] defined the GET, HEAD, and POST methods as well as listing the PUT, DELETE, LINK and UNLINK methods under additional methods. However, the HTTP/1.1 specification[50] formally defined and added five new methods: PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE. Any client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods. If a method is unknown to an intermediate, it will be treated as an unsafe and non-idempotent method. There is no limit to the number of methods that can be defined, which allows for future methods to be specified without breaking existing infrastructure. For example, WebDAV defined seven new methods and RFC 5789 specified the PATCH method.

        <h1 id="h5"><u>Dynamic Webpages</u></h1>
        <img src="C:\Users\cacet\Desktop\Sample\dynamic.png" alt="Dynamic Webpages" width="300" border="3">
        <p>
          A dynamic web page is built at runtime, unlike a static web page that is delivered exactly as stored. There are two types: server-side and client-side. In server-side dynamic pages, the web server uses scripts to build the page based on certain parameters before sending it to the browser. In client-side dynamic pages, JavaScript runs in the user's browser to update or modify the page as it loads, using the Document Object Model (DOM). These client-side dynamic pages can still be hosted on static platforms like GitHub Pages or Amazon S3, as long as no server-side code is used.

        <p>
          An application server is a server that runs software to deliver business applications over a network, usually sitting behind web servers in a typical web setup. It acts as a service layer, providing tools and components to developers through an application programming interface (API). Application servers often include features like clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing to ensure performance and reliability, allowing developers to concentrate on writing the business logic of the application.
